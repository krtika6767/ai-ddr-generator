(Driving Data Report Generator using AI)

📌 Overview

The AI DDR Generator is a smart system that automatically generates Driving Data Reports (DDR) using artificial intelligence. It helps in analyzing driving data and converting it into structured, readable reports without manual effort.

This project is designed to save time, reduce human error, and improve efficiency in handling driving-related data.

🎯 Features

📊 Automated report generation from raw data

🤖 AI-based text generation for summaries

⚡ Fast and efficient processing

🧾 Structured and easy-to-read output

🔍 Reduces manual work and errors

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Machine Learning / NLP

Pandas (for data processing)

Scikit-learn / basic ML models

Flask (for web interface, if applicable)

⚙️ How It Works

User uploads or inputs driving data

Data is preprocessed and cleaned

AI model analyzes patterns and key metrics

System generates a structured DDR report

Final report is displayed or downloaded
